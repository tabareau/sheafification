Changes:

- All the proofs that are not in the HoTT book are now detailled in the paper
  and the other are referenced as precise lemmas of the HoTT book.
- The related work as been moved and pint explicitely as such
- The contribution of the article with respect to the fact that Lawvere-Tierney sheafification
   does not exist in higher toposes is now made clearer
- The introduction takes more time to explain the link between HoTT
  and higher toposes.
- About the connection between Grothentieck and Lawvere-Tierney
  sheafification in the higher topos setting: we now talk about
  synthetic sheafification for Lawvere-Tierney (instead of
  generalized) and metion the potential connection as a future work
  that is beyond the scope of this paper.- We have added a plan of paper
- Minor corrections have been applied
- A global pass on the English has been done
- The need to use the work of [Bou16] is now explicit in Section 2.3
- Section 3.4 is now explicit about the use of type-in-type.
- Non-scientific expressions (such as "tedious" or "popping out") have
  been removed.
